"Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be done with my corpse,
the first being scientific or medical use. Once my dead body is no longer of
any use to me, it may as well be of some use to someone. Besides, I often enjoy
rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants)."

"I've read that male dolphins try to have sex with humans, and female apes
solicit sex from humans. What is wrong with giving them what they want, if
that's what turns you on, or even just to gratify them?"

"It doesn't take special talents to reproduce--even plants can do it. On
the other hand, contributing to a program like Emacs takes real skill.
That is really something to be proud of."

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact,
GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an
operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU
system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components
comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing
it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is
often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU
system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using 
it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the
other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but
useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux
is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically
GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really
distributions of GNU/Linux.

/g/ is the fidgety little sister who likes the latest gadgets and breaks her
computer.

/b/ is the older brother who is insanely smart and capable but knows it to be
futile and instead sets about amusing himself knowing it means more than money
can buy because of his wizdom.

He also molests his sister, /g/.

Anon, I just killed in speech class. Some chick gave a speech about
abstinence and said she was a virgin. After she was finished, it was my
turn.

I then got up and said, "My speech is about Windows vs.
Linux...which means I'm also a virgin."

The room erupted with laughter and I cried on the inside.
